While international credit cards like Visa and Mastercard are accepted at high-end hotels and upscale restaurants in China, Alipay (支付宝) and WeChat Pay (微信支付) are generally more convenient and widely accepted for most everyday transactions.

## Setting up Alipay or WeChat Pay
The Alipay service provides a standalone mobile application known as "Alipay," which can be conveniently obtained from popular app stores like the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. In contrast, WeChat Pay is seamlessly integrated within the WeChat app, allowing users to access its features directly through the same application.
